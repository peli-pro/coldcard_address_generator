# Generate addresses for coldcard
This script will generate lists of addresses from your coldcard xpubs.
It will generate external (recieve) and internal (change) addresses.
You will get those values from the public.txt file that you can export from the coldcard.
It uses the bitcoinjs-lib found here: https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib

BEFORE YOU TRUST THIS SCRIPT PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK THAT IT WORKS CORRECTLY, SEE THE LAST SECTION !!!!!

## Get your public.txt from your coldcard
Insert a SD-Card in your Cold-Card    
```
Settings -> Blockchain -> Choose Bitcoin or Testnet: Bitcoin
```
then 
```
Advanced -> MicroSD Card ->Dump summary
```
this will create the file public.txt on your sd card. 

Open public.txt and get the xpubs from these sections:
:
```
## For BIP44 / Electrum: m/44'/0'/{account}'/{change}/{idx}
## For BIP49 (P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH): m/49'/0'/{account}'/{change}/{idx}
## For BIP84 (Native Segwit P2PKH): m/84'/0'/{account}'/{change}/{idx}
```
